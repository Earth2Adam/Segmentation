# Semantic Segmentation Research

### WHAT IS SEMANTIC SEGMENTATION? 

“Semantic segmentation is a computer vision task that assigns a class label to pixels using a deep learning (DL) algorithm. It is one of three sub-categories in the overall process of image segmentation that helps computers understand visual information.” –IBM

### WHAT IS EFFICIENTVIT? 

“[A] new family of high-resolution vision models with novel multi-scale linear attention.” –EfficientViT 

This model differs from previous implementations due to its utilization of multi-scale linear attention. By avoiding the implementation of softmax attention in high-resolution dense prediction tasks, EfficientViT is more efficient in terms of latency and accuracy of object recognition in images. In short, this is accomplished via a combination of ReLu functions and convolutions via FFN layers.
